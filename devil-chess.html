		<div><p>The Devil Chess riddle was recently a hot topic with the <a href="http://datagenetics.com/blog/december12014/index.html">datagenetics.com blog
post</a> presenting the
problem and a solution. We discussed it among friends and found solution, which
we believe is simpler for it is does not use strange board partitions.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Shamelessly stolen from the aforementioned blog post. If you read it just skip
to the next part.</p>
<p>It's one of those proverbial prisoner problems where you are condemned to die
unless you can prove your intelligence to a devious jailer. You, and your
friend, are incarcerated. Your jailer offers a challenge. If you complete the
challenge you are both free to go. Here are the rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The jailer will take you into a private cell. In the cell will be a chessboard
  and a jar containing 64 coins.</li>
<li>The jailer will take the coins, one-by-one, and place a coin on each square on
  the board. He will place the coins randomly on the board. Some coins will be
  heads, and some tails (or maybe they will be all heads, or all tails; you have
  no idea. It's all at the jailers whim. He may elect to look and choose to make
  a pattern himself, he may toss them placing them the way they land, he might
  look at them as he places them, he might not …). If you attempt to interfere
  with the placing of the coins, it is instant death for you. If you attempt to
  coerce, suggest, or persuade the jailer in any way, instant death. All you can
  do it watch.</li>
<li>Once all the coins have been laid out, the jailer will point to one of the
  squares on the board and say: “This one!” He is indicating the magic square.
  This square is the key to your freedom.</li>
<li>The jailer will then allow you to turn over one coin on the board. Just one. A
  single coin, but it can be any coin, you have full choice. If the coin you
  select is a head, it will flip to a tail. If it is a tail it will flip to a
  head. This is the only change you are allowed to make to the jailers initial
  layout.</li>
<li>You will then be lead out of the room. If you attempt to leave other messages
  behind, or clues for your friend … yes, you guessed it, instant death!</li>
<li>The jailer will then bring your friend into the room.</li>
<li>Your friend will look at the board (no touching allowed), then examine the
  board of coins and decide which location he thinks is the magic square.</li>
<li>He gets one chance only (no feedback). Based on the configuration of the coins
  he will point to one square and say: “This one!”</li>
<li>If he guesses correctly, you are both pardoned, and instantly set free. If he
  guesses incorrectly, you are both executed.</li>
<li>The jailer explains all these rules, to both you and your friend, beforehand
  and then gives you time to confer with each other to devise a strategy for
  which coin to flip.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our solution</h2>
<p>Now for some notations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>T</code> is the initial set of squares with tails on them. We'll only work with
them and not heads ones (yes it's arbitrary).</li>
<li><code>T'</code> is that same set after flipping one coin.</li>
<li><code>tx</code> is the column index (0 to 7) of a square <code>t</code> belonging to <code>T</code> (or <code>T'</code>).</li>
<li><code>ty</code> is its row index.</li>
<li><code>m = (mx, my)</code> is the magic square.</li>
<li><code>f = (fx, fy)</code> is the square under the coin we'll flip.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll always use the binary representation of all those values. We're working
on a tore (ℤ/8ℤ), i.e. every value is modulo 8, and -3 is the same as 5.</p>
<p>And now the solution itself. For simplicity purposes we'll work independently
on the rows and the columns.
Let's compute</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>θx = ⊕(tx for t in T)
θy = ⊕(ty for t in T)
θ = (θx, θy)
</pre></div>


<p><code>θ</code> is the xor of all tails squares. We'd like <code>θ'</code> (<code>θ</code> after the
flip) to equal <code>m</code>. How?</p>
<p>We introduce their difference:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>δ = (δx, δy)
δ = m ⊕ θ
δ = (mx ⊕ θx, my ⊕ θy)
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>δ</code> represents a square on the board! What happens when we flip it?</p>
<p>We have <code>T' = T ⊕ {δ}</code>. Then</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>θ&#39;x = ⊕(tx for t in T&#39;)
θ&#39;x = ⊕(tx for t in T) ⊕ δx
θ&#39;x = θx ⊕ (mx ⊕ θx)
θ&#39;x = θx ⊕ mx ⊕ θx
θ&#39;x = mx
</pre></div>


<p>Same goes for <code>θ'y = m</code></p>
<p>Therefore <code>θ' = m</code>
Therefore <strong>by flipping the coin on the square <code>m ⊕ (⊕T)</code>, <code>⊕T'</code> gives us the
magic square!</strong></p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>I planned to include a demo, stealing the base code from datagenetics.com's
blog and adapting it to this solution. However, upon reading the source, it
appeared that the computation of the parity did not use their aforementioned
board partitions, but the same computation I use: <code>Parity = ⊕T</code>, which gives the
same result... We now feel a bit stupid for thinking we had another solution,
but since the article is written we go forth.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed it!</p></div>
