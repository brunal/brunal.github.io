		<div><p><a href="http://torrentfreak.com/first-episodes-of-game-of-thrones-season-5-leak-online-150412/">The first four episodes of game of thrones
leaked</a>
nearly 36 hours ago. They've extensively downloaded, and the only tracking HBO
seemed to be a watermark in the bottom left corner of the screen. Once blurred,
it is useless. This impresses me. It's 2015 and all you're using is a "confirm
you're deleted" + "your copy is watermarked" for protection? There are simple
schemes that would have allowed HBO to track the leak.</p>
<p>The idea is very simple: make each copy unique in a non-visible way.</p>
<h2>Credits length</h2>
<p>A first approach would be to change the length of the credits: its basic
duration seems to be <span class="math">\(t = 88\)</span> seconds. If you must provide <span class="math">\(n\)</span> copies (<span class="math">\(n\)</span> odd)
then distribute copies with
</p>
<div class="math">$$t - \frac{n}{2000} &lt; t' &lt; t + \frac{n}{2000}$$</div>
<p>
Every copy has credits with a different length: they are a few milliseconds
shorter or longer than they should be, and by analyzing the file one can know
for whom it was intended.
This is obviously easy to defeat: just clip the credits. But it is a first step
in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Scenes length</h2>
<p>Next iteration would be to change the length of each scene by a few
milliseconds. One can count that the first episode holds <span class="math">\(s = 18\)</span> scenes. Each
scene lasts several minutes. Once again each copy can be made shorter or longer
by a couple milliseconds, providing a unique fingerprint for each version sent.</p>
<p>Let's call <span class="math">\(n\)</span> the number of recipients and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> the difference in milliseconds
between the shortest and the longest version of a scene (<span class="math">\(k\)</span> will be the same
for all scenes). We want</p>
<div class="math">$$
    n = s^k \\
    log(n) = k \times log(s) \\
    k = \frac{log(n)}{log(s)} \\
$$</div>
<p>Say we have <span class="math">\(n = 1 000 000\)</span> (I think that the real number is wayyyy lower).
Which gives
</p>
<div class="math">$$ k = \frac{log(1000000)}{log(18)} = 3.96 $$</div>
<p>
You only need 4 versions of each scene, which will be between 2 ms shorter and
1 ms longer.</p>
<p>This, in turn, is difficult to counter for one does not know the expected
length of each scene.</p>
<h2>Constant total length</h2>
<p>A small caveat is the fact that the total length may appear a bit off, which
could tip a leaker. 2 easy solutions come to mind:</p>
<h3>Credits compensation</h3>
<p>Change the credits length to compensate. In the worst case you'll have to
make the credits <span class="math">\(18 \times 2 = 36 ms\)</span> longer.</p>
<h3>Self-compensating offsets</h3>
<p>Distribute the changes so all files have the expected length. Let's see (for
fun) what it gives (suppose <span class="math">\(k \equiv 2 \pmod 1\)</span>):</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(C_k(s, K) =\)</span> <span class="math">\(\#\{(c_i)_{(i ≤ s)} \mid 0 ≤ c_i ≤ k - 1, \sum_{i=1}^s c_i = K\}\)</span>
the set of all sequences of <span class="math">\(s\)</span> posive elements below <span class="math">\(k\)</span> which sum to <span class="math">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<p>How do we pick <span class="math">\(K\)</span>?  We want the sum of the centered <span class="math">\(c_i\)</span> to be 0, so
</p>
<div class="math">$$
    \sum_{i=1}^s c_i - \frac{k -1}{2} = 0 \\
    \sum_{i=1}^s c_i = \sum_{i=1}^s \frac{k - 1}{2} \\
    \sum_{i=1}^s c_i = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{4} - \frac{s}{2} = K \\
$$</div>
<p>We first pick the offset of the first scene:
</p>
<div class="math">$$
    C_k(s, K) = C_k(s - 1, K) + C_k(s - 1, K - 1) + \cdots + C_k(s - 1, K - k + 1) \\
    C_k(s, K) = \sum_{i=0}^{min(K, k - 1)} C_k(s - 1, K - i) \\
$$</div>
<p>
And the terminal cases are
</p>
<div class="math">$$
    C_k(0, 0) = 1 \\
    C_k(0, K) = 0 \quad if \, K ≠ 0
$$</div>
<p>With <span class="math">\(C_k(s, \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{4} - \frac{s}{2}) = n\)</span> we can get <span class="math">\(k\)</span>
from <span class="math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
<!--
In our case it gives <span class="math">\(k = XXX\)</span>. Still really low.
--></p>
<h2>Further considerations</h2>
<p>There is still one way to blur that watermarking scheme: when the leaker has 2
copies. He can then notice the discrepancies in scenes length. He may decide to
- average each scene length. There are scene-length encoding schemes that make
the average of every 2 sequences unique (left as an exercice to the reader ☺)
and therefore solve this. Same with 3 copies, or 4 copies... but the encoding
requires a <span class="math">\(k\)</span> always higher.
- take the min or max of every scene. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction#Error-correcting_code">Error-correcting codes</a>
should help.
- randomly clip every scene.</p>
<p>The case of a leaker getting her hands on 2 copies is however really less
likely.</p>
<p>This makes the afore-presented watermarking scheme resistant while simple to
implement.</p>
<p>Apart from that I think that binge-watching the first 4 episodes is a stupid
idea that will make you ache for a month waiting for the 5th episode ☺.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
